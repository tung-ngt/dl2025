### Deep Learning framework in Rust from scratch
I have implemeted the model and training, testing, metric calculation all from scartch in Rust with no library at all.

### This code is the final version of the code, to see the full code please go to [implementation link](https://github.com/tung-ngt/ml-rs)

### Running Instruction
if rust is installed:

`cargo run --release -- <config.txt> <train.csv> <test.csv> <epochs>`


else you can run the binary. Note that the binary is compile for x86_64 linux
